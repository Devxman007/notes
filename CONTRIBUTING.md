## Merge requests

You are more than welcome to contribute to our notes page. Fork the project, commit your changes, and then send a pull request.

There are a few guidelines to be followed:

* English language only (preferably American English for consistency)
* Notes should be written in Markdown and follow the Markdown language specification
* Try to follow the current structure of the documents as much as possible, for maximum clarity and readability
* Order of content should follow the order of lessons on the freeCodeCamp courses (and the livestreams) as closely as possible
* No content outside of the course's progress, such as:
  * current freeCodeCamp course content that we haven't yet reached on the livestreams
  * content from freeCodeCamp courses other than the one you are contributing notes to (such as the *Front End Development Libraries Certification*, or JavaScript bootcamp content being added to WebDev bootcamp notes)
  * content from resources outside of freeCodeCamp or the current bootcamp's livestreams (including StackOverflow or MDN)
* Content mentioned on livestreams that doesn't appear in the freeCodeCamp courses (or hasn't appeared *yet*) is allowed
* No spam or advertising and no content that might be considered harmful
* No misleading content, even as a joke
* Repository managers reserve a right to edit any pull requests to conform them to the contributing guidelines and document structure

## Donating

We are thankful to the [Class Central](https://www.classcentral.com/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) communities for organizing these courses without any profit incentive and letting all of us take part and learn for free. Therefore, this project will not ask for any financial support.

Instead, consider donating to freeCodeCamp instead. freeCodeCamp provides quality tutorials and courses for free. By supporting them, you're supporting not only a group of volunteers that dedicate their time to share their expertise without a price tag attached, but also a large and diverse community of learners (and, by extension, us).

## Spread the word

Sharing is caring. Share this resource with fellow learners, as well as friends, family, other people who want to learn WebDev or JavaScript, complete strangers, or your grandma's dog. We all profit from Class Central and freeCodeCamp becoming more popular.
